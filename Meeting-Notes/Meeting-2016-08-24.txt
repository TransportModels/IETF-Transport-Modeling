1. Summary of IETF-96 discussions

	- Presentation of the Transport Requirements & Gap Analysis Draft.

	- Discussion around the design team in CCAMP WG
		- Use Wiki to document use cases and modeling (instance diagrams)
			- Wiki better with diagrams and drawings
			- Can be moved later in formal draft
		- Use Github to post existing work - requirements, use cases and modeling (instance diagrams)
		- Abstract for goals of the design team [Done]
			- CCAMP team working with the area director.

	- Modeling (brainstorming exercise) of few micro scenarios:
		- Modeling of L0 topology and service with Transponders and WSS
		- Modeling of NE with multiple chassis/shelf with no inter-chassis connectivity

2. Current status

	- [Complete] Analysis completed for single layer, single domain
		- Feedback provided to TE Topology (NNI link)
		- Feedback provided to TE Tunnel

	- [Complete] Submission of IETF Drafts identified as the gap:
		- L1/OTN Tunnel Model
		- Update of L1/OTN TE Topology Model
		- Alarm Model

	- [Pending: Priority#1] Analysis pending for the following use cases:
		- End-to-End service in a single layer, multi-domain network
		- End-to-End service in a multi-layer, single domain network

	- [Complete] Provide additional feedback to TE Tunnel model (Xian)
		- Definition of notification using XPATH and pub/sub model (AI: Tarek)

	- [Pending] Review of the updated TE Tunnel model

3. Next analysis and modeling activities

	- Complete pending items

	- Wiki / Github Documentation:
		- Transport use case modeling
		- Create a GitHub page (AI: Anurag)

	- Analysis of Virtual Network use case

	- New model drafts:
		- L2 MEF service model - Any IPR issues?
			- IPR might not be an issue - (AI:Tara to check)

		- Path Computation model ?
			- Need to check with Sergio & Italo

		- Virtual Network model (Based on Virtual Network use case analysis)

	- New terminology / name for the tunnel/service

	- TE Topology analysis for technology specific attributes
		- Which are technology specific attributes?
		- Where should these attributes go, i.e. which CCAMP model?
