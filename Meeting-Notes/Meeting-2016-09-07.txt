Discussion of Multi-Domain Use Case - presented by Xian

	- How to model the UNI link in case of, for example, it has ETH signal but encapsulated in ODU? There are views that think it should be modeled as a multi-layer topology; but no agreement made yet
	  - Discussed points:
	    - If ETH signal is encapsulated in the ODU using GFP then this this L2 over L1, i.e. multi-layer use case
	    - If ETH signal is connected to the L2 device then this is L2 network, i.e. single-layer use case
	- Multi-domain is different from Multi-network use case
	  - Domain is an administrative boundary, while the network can be split into multiple sub-networks for ease in control / manageability.
	  - Domain controller exposes single domain, but can expose multiple networks. The following example was shared - vendor's domain controller might expose multiple networks each with set of NE Types (as a result of acquisition, legacy & next-gen NE Types, etc.).
	  - Domain controller can also have a need to model iNNI links that connect networks.
	- How to model iNNI links? What is the parent network for iNNI links.
	  - One suggestion - model a paret network that contains sub-networks. Model the iNNI link connecting sub-networks under the parent network.
	- Is the iNNI link creation top-down or bottom-up. That is, does the operator create iNNI link using the orchestrator, or is it set using remote-id and plug-id in the domian controller?
	  - It appears that the iNNI link creation is more top-down process. That is, operator creates the link in the orchestrator.
	  - Subnetworks in the domain controller should only model edge ports. Remote edge port knowledge is not typically required by the individual network. The parent network, or orchestrator keeps the inter-network links.
	- How the MDSC know the correlation of C-Rx and network-side NEs (Page 4 point 2)?  In this use case, that is the business boundary and should be known somehow by provider, so they are configured on to the MDSC.
